# My Personal Tools and Scripts

This repository contains scripts and tools I've created to address repetitive tasks and streamline data management. While these are tailored to my specific needs, they are open for others who might find them useful.

## Features
- **Data Management Tools**: Scripts for sorting, cleaning, and organizing spreadsheet data.
- **Automation Utilities**: Tools to create consistent folder structures and schedule students into lab times.
- **Exploratory Projects**: Includes experiments with audio processing and WordPress theme development.

## Technologies Used
- **Languages**: Python, BASH, PHP, HTML, CSS.
- **UI Framework**: Tkinter (for Python-based graphical interfaces).

## Notes
These scripts are designed primarily for macOS but include cross-platform compatibility where possible. They "scratch my own itch," but I'm open to collaboration if someone has ideas or improvements to share.

Feel free to explore, adapt, or learn from these tools as you see fit.
